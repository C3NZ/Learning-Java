 * 
 * <p>Hello, and welcome to your very first java program! In order to make a program,
 * you will need a class as demonstrated below. Inside every first class of your programs
 * there must be a method named:
 * 
 * <p><b>public static void main(String args[]){}</b>
 * 
 * <p>This is because main is a reserved word for java's virtual machine and whenever it
 * is implemented as below it will be the entry point of your program, and all code
 * will be executed from there on.
